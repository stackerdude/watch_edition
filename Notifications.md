# Creating Your First Notification
***
The watch is capable of creating different types of notifications. For this exercise we'll be creating a "Demo" notification that pops up saying "This is a demo notification"

 ✨**(S U R P R I S E !)**✨

 We'll be using TDD AGAIN. This is your life now...

Here are the principles again for your reference:

* Write a failing test
* Write just enough code to make the test pass
    * YAGNI - You Ain't Going To Need It
* Refactor
* Write the next failing test
* Rinse and repeat

### Write a failing test
We want our Demo notification to say "This is a Demo Notification: [message]" where [message] is our custom message sent through the form. 

Create the file `client/spec/notifications/DemoNotification.spec.js`
