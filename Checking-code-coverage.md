Code coverage is automatically reported by jest our unit testing framework, a small summary table will be output to the terminal each time we run tests. 

A more in depth report on each file and the function coverage is created in the coverage folder in our watch_edition project directory and can be be seen when we open the link below in our browser.

```file:///<path-to-your-project-directory>/watch_edition/coverage/lcov-report/index.html```
