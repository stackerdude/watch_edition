**How do I run a subset of tests?**

Replace it and describe with fit or fdescribe

**Error: `libsass` bindings not found. Try reinstalling `node-sass`?**

You've probably switched node version. Try running `npm rebuild node-sass`

**I already have node installed, but it's a different version**

Use N to easily install and switch between different versions of Node https://github.com/tj/n
