There are a number of pieces in the tech stack but many of them are just to provide automation and don't have to touched or understood in order to build Proto Watch apps.

During the project you'll mostly be working with JavaScript, Backbone and Jasmine.

You should only need to work on files inside the ```client/``` directory if you are building a watch app.

- [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) - Javascript app framework
- [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) - JavaScript utility methods
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - HTML/DOM Manipulation
- [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) - HTML Templating
- [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Styling
